Thanks for your contribution!

## To contribute a screencast:

### Requirements:

* R
* Some way to record the screencast
* Record screencast
* Send to us, at which point we'll splice it in between the intro and exit material that make these consistent.

Don't put the video in this repo, though do include any scripts and notes to produce the screencast. Put a link in the screencast to the video once it is up.
